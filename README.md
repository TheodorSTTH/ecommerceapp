## About

This is a e-commerce app. It uses the web framework Next.js, tailwindcss and DaisyUI for styling, Firebase for the main backend and PayPal for payment options. The project was made in just one day and lacks a lot of features, but it still manages to do the most important things. You can browse different products, add them to your cart and unadd them.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Before you run anything, remember to occupy the .env.local file with your own firebase keys.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
